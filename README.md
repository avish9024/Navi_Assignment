# Navi_Assignment

Made two classes 
1. Loan Details - which is the pojo class
2. Loan Service - a service class where processing of ledger is done 

For running this application, open the Navi_Assignment folder in any ide.
Go to the Loan Service class.

Inside it there I have used File for reading the test cases. For ex- i have used testCase1.txt.
So I have specified the localtion of my testcase file in main method.

Run LoanService.main() method

Output will be seen in the console.
